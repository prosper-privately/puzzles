# The Pastrami Incident

Your friend runs a beloved local deli, famous for one thing above all else: the pastrami recipe.
Lately, he has noticed some suspicious customers lingering too long, asking oddly specific questions, and ordering some odd sandwiches.

Last night, while taking out the trash, he found shredded slips of paper covered in what looks like coded messages. He took them to the police, but they said there is no evidence of a crime.

So he brought the scraps to you.

The deli is counting on you. Can you break the code and uncover the plan to steal the pastrami recipe?

Did you get here from my blog? If not, maybe check out the [announcement post for this puzzle.](https://prosperprivately.substack.com/p/the-pastrami-incident?utm_source=gh)

## Your objective

Decrypt enough of the conspirators' messages to convince the police to get involved.

**Victory:** When you can read most of the messages clearly, you've cracked the code.

## Instructions

1. Download the puzzle by [clicking here](https://github.com/prosper-privately/puzzles/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Unzip the file:
   - Windows: Right-click → Extract All…
   - macOS: Double-click the ZIP file
3. Open the folder `savethedeli`
4. Look at the encrypted messages in `cipher.txt`. If you don't see that file, you're in the wrong folder!
5. Look at the instructions in `README.md` (That's this file.)
   `.md` files are just plain text. You can open them with TextEdit or Notepad.
6. If you get stuck, look at `hint1.md`. If you are still stuck, continue with `hint2.md` and so on.
   Some of the hints include multiple files. Always start with the one ending in `.md`.

## Requirements

- Solving by hand is possible, but some may find it tedious.
- Some of the hints include scripts or web pages to help do the calculations for you.
- Non-technical folks should stick to the web pages (just open the HTML file in your browser).
- Technical folks can try out the scripts, or even write their own version.

## Structure

- The encrypted messages are in `cipher.txt`, one message per line.
- Hints are in this directory and numbered in order.
  If you get stuck, look at `hint1.md`. If you are still stuck, look at `hint2.md`,
  etc.
- The solution is in the directory `solution`.
  That includes the details of how `cipher.txt` was generated.

## Basic Terms

**Plaintext**
The original, readable message before encryption.

**Ciphertext**
The encrypted, unreadable message after encryption.
