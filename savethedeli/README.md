# The Deli Mystery

Your friend runs a beloved local deli, famous for one thing above all else: the pastrami recipe.
Lately, he has noticed some suspicious customers lingering too long, asking oddly specific questions, and ordering some odd sandwiches.

Last night, while taking out the trash, he found shredded slips of paper covered in what looks like coded messages. He took them to the police, but they said there is no evidence of a crime.

So he brought the scraps to you.

The deli is counting on you. Can you break the code and uncover the plan to steal the pastrami recipe?

## Your objective

Decrypt enough of the conspirators' messages to convince the police to get involved.

**Victory:** When you can read most of the messages clearly, you've cracked the code.

## Requirements

- Solving by hand is technically possible, but will likely get very tedious.
  Basic computer scripting is recommended.
- The hints that include code are written in the Ruby programming language.

## Structure

- The encrypted messages are in `cipher.txt`, one message per line.
- Hints are in this directory and numbered in order.
  If you get stuck, look at `hint1.md`. If you are still stuck, look at `hint2.md`,
  etc.
- The solution is in the directory `solution`.
  That includes the details of how `cipher.txt` was generated.

## Basic Terms

**Plaintext**
The original, readable message before encryption.

**Ciphertext**
The encrypted, unreadable message after encryption.

Either way, I'd love to hear what you think.
I'm always looking to meet more people interested in privacy, security, and cryptography.
