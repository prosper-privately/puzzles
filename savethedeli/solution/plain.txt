TONIGHT WE COPY THE RECIPE FROM THE SAFE AFTER THE DELI CLOSES.

THE RECIPE IS ON PAPER. THE SAFE IS BEHIND THE COUNTER.

IF ANYONE ASKS. WE ARE FOOD BLOGGERS. WE LOVE THE DELI.

THE PASSWORD IS PAS TRAM I. HE THINKS THE SPACES MAKE IT SECURE.

TONIGHT WE OPEN THE SAFE AND COPY THE RECIPE. WORK FAST.

DO NOT TAKE THE BOOK. COPY THE RECIPE AND LEAVE THE SAFE CLOSED.

BRING A CAMERA. TAKE A PHOTO OF THE RECIPE. NO FLASH.

MEET AT THE DELI AT NOON TOMORROW. ACT NORMAL. ORDER SOUP.

AFTER WE COPY THE RECIPE. WE SELL IT TO A RIVAL DELI.

DO NOT EAT THE EVIDENCE AGAIN. LAST TIME YOU LEFT GREASE ON THE PAGES.
