# Hint 2

Your friend thinks he heard one of the suspicious characters say the phrase "one time pad".
He doesn't know what that means, but he also doesn't think these conspirators are
really smart enough to use cryptography correctly.

## Basic Terms

**Key**
Secret information used to encrypt and decrypt messages. In a one-time pad, the key is a sequence of random values.

**One-Time Pad (OTP)**
An encryption scheme that combines each character of plaintext with a corresponding random key value. When used correctly (with a truly random key, used only once), it provides perfect secrecy—mathematically unbreakable.
